# Performance-Measurement-Modeling
These models were tested using the Deep Learning (Spiking Neural Network (SNN), Hybrid DNN, and LSTM) and Statistical Models provided in the Jupyter Notebooks. These files also come with their respective datasets. Google Colab is needed to run the notebooks. Prior to running the notebooks, make sure the Google Drives are mounted to your own directory and if possible create and activate a virtual environment in your own machine.
